# Weighted Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function and related functions

Starting to put together some code that uses weighting methods to adjust survival analyses for unevenly sampled sites (i.e. to avoid biasing towards site with most samples). Functions include the survival estimator, quantile estimation, plotting functions, and a permutation/simulation based Log-Rank test for comparing two groups. FYI, things are poorly annotated right now as I work on documentation.
